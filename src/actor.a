; ------------- How movement works! -------------------------
; We have space for N actors on screen (atm max 7 or 8, 7 when player can shoot).
; Actors are spawned from level data when tiles come into view.
; Each actor has state (0-dead,1-alive,2-in air,3-flying)
; Each actor has x,y pos as 16bit value (tilenr 0-255,subtileoffset in pixels 0-15,subpixel accuracy 4bit)
; Each actor has a vx,vy velocity (vx 1 byte, vy 16 bit)
; Movement is computed in main loop after all time critical work is done, results copied to
; actor data, so keep it as double buffer data later!
; If actor vx is not null check for collision with wall and stop side movement (maybe flag for AI).
; Then check for y position if there is a tile underneath (if not start fall) or if falling if we
; are in a tile, then place on top and stop fall.
; We have to know for every tile if it is background or not, place background tiles at begin of
; range so we can use one compare to decide whether collision or not.
